    for energy prediction.
-   **Feature Importance Analysis:** Understand key drivers of renewable
    energy production.
-   **Scalable:** Easily extendable to other time series datasets.
-   **Exportable Models:** Save and load trained models (`.pkl`) for
    deployment.
-   **Visualizations:** Feature importance plots and evaluation metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   Python 3.10+
-   Pandas, NumPy for data processing
-   Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
-   Scikit-learn, XGBoost for modeling
-   Jupyter Notebook for experimentation
