# Renewable Energy Trends Prediction 2025

This project predicts renewable energy trends for 2025 using machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LSTM.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- LSTM model for time series prediction
- Visualization of prediction trends
