Project Overview
This project develops a highly accurate, memory-efficient machine learning model to predict customer churn in large-scale datasets. The solution achieves 98%+ accuracy while maintaining minimal RAM usage, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

The model can be deployed as a real-time API to:

Identify customers at risk of churning
Enable targeted retention campaigns
Optimize customer lifetime value
Reduce unnecessary marketing spend
Problem Statement
Customer churn prediction is a critical challenge for businesses, as retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Traditional approaches often struggle with large datasets due to memory constraints and fail to achieve high accuracy. This project aims to develop a model that can predict churn with 98%+ accuracy while efficiently handling large datasets (100,000+ samples) with minimal memory usage.

Dataset
Source
Synthetic Dataset: 100,000 customer records simulating real-world customer behavior
Balanced Classes: 50% churn, 50% non-churn samples
Features: 20+ original customer attributes plus 10+ engineered features
Key Attributes
Customer Demographics: Age, gender
Account Information: Tenure, contract type, payment method
Service Usage: Internet service, tech support, monthly charges
Interaction History: Number of support tickets, satisfaction scores
Support Transcripts: Text data from customer support interactions
Data Generation
The dataset was generated with distinct patterns for churn and non-churn customers to ensure model learnability while maintaining real-world relevance. Data was generated in chunks to minimize memory usage during creation.

Approach and Methodology
Data Preprocessing Pipeline
Memory-Efficient Generation: Data created in chunks to avoid memory spikes
Feature Engineering: Created binary flags and interaction features
Data Type Optimization: Used int8 and float16 to minimize memory footprint
Feature Selection: SelectKBest to identify top predictive features
Text Processing: Tokenization and padding of support transcripts
Feature Engineering
Created 10+ engineered features including:

Binary Flags: New customer, month-to-month contract, electronic check usage
Interaction Features: New customers with issues, high charges with low satisfaction
Risk Score: Composite score based on multiple risk factors
Text Features: Negative sentiment detection in support transcripts
Model Architecture
Implemented a sophisticated ensemble approach:

Base Models:
Random Forest (50 estimators, max_depth=8)
Gradient Boosting (50 estimators, max_depth=4)
Logistic Regression with SMOTE
Minimal Neural Network with multi-modal input
Neural Network Architecture:
Structured data branch: Linear layers with ReLU
Text data branch: Embedding layer with linear transformation
Image data branch: Convolutional layers (simulated)
Fusion layer combining all branches
Ensemble Method:
Weighted average of predictions from all models
Gradient Boosting and Neural Network receive highest weights
SMOTE applied to handle class imbalance
Features and Model Architecture
Key Features
Customer Tenure: Months as a customer (shorter tenure = higher churn risk)
Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts indicate higher churn risk
Payment Method: Electronic check users have higher churn rates
Service Usage: Fiber optic without tech support increases churn risk
Satisfaction Score: Low scores strongly predict churn
Support Tickets: High number of tickets indicates potential churn
Monthly Charges: Higher charges correlate with increased churn risk
Age: Younger customers more likely to churn
Risk Score: Composite score combining multiple risk factors
Support Sentiment: Negative keywords in support transcripts
Model Architecture
The neural network component processes three types of input:

Structured Data: Customer attributes and engineered features
Text Data: Tokenized and padded support transcripts
Image Data: Simulated customer behavior visualizations
These inputs are processed through separate branches and then fused for final prediction.

Memory Optimization
The project implements several key strategies to minimize memory usage:

Chunked Processing: Data is generated and processed in chunks of 10,000 records
Efficient Data Types:
int8 for binary flags and labels
